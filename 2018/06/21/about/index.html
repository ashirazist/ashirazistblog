<p>My name is Amin Shirazi. You can know more about me on the <a href="https://ashirazist.github.io/"><strong>homepage</strong></a> and my <a href="https://ashirazist.github.io/src/CV/cv.pdf"><strong>CV</strong></a>. I have decided to share my experiences about what I know in statistics and its application in R, and anything which I think is worth reading with others here in this blog. I never consider myself a pro in writting blogs about my major, so I would be more than happy if you could share your thoughts with me about my posts or about what you think could be presented in a better way. I just enjoy learning new things and sharing them with you. I have promised to myself to update my posts once I get feedback or when I find a better replacement for what I have in a post. What you see in my posts are just how I see things, which might seem dummy to you, and if I use someone else&rsquo;s stuff (posts, codes or opinion), I will mention their names.</p>
