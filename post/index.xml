      <description>About the time this post being written I am writting this post in the Spring break of 2020. What should be remembered is not the Spring break, but the current global epidmic of coronavirus also known as COVID-19. There have been thousands of confirmed cases and many deaths all around the world, and unfortunately, the number is still going up. Many countries are completely shut down due to this pandemic issue.</description>

      <description>My name is Amin Shirazi. You can know more about me on the homepage and my CV. I have decided to share my experiences about what I know in statistics and its application in R, and anything which I think is worth reading with others here in this blog. I never consider myself a pro in writting blogs about my major, so I would be more than happy if you could share your thoughts with me about my posts or about what you think could be presented in a better way.</description>
