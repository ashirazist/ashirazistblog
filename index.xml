      <description>My name is Amin Shirazi. You can know more about me on the homepage and my CV. I have decided to share my experiences about what I know in statistics and its application in R, and anything which I think is worth reading with others here in this blog. I never consider myself a pro in writting blogs about my major, so I would be more than happy if you could share your thoughts with me about my posts or about what you think could be presented in a better way.</description>
